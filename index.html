              <br>We are four students studying Information- and communication technology at Lunds University and have done a project in EDA095 Networking Programming.

            <p><font size=5><b>ABOUT THE SQUAD|CODE</b></font>
            <br>The purpose of Squad Code is that users shall be able to share programming code with each other in real time. As a user you should be able to create different classes and share them instantaneously. The system shall also include a chat forum where users can talk to each other in real time. Squad Code will make it both fun and effective to write code with your squad! Your Squad can chat, can create classes and write code to share with each other. The best part your squad can see everything instantly!

            <p><font size=5><b>EVALUATION</b></font>
            <br>The program is aimed to share code in real-time on a website or a program between users. For this course we have decided that some of our ideas had to be scratched because of the amount of workload. Such as the format feature and also the ability to create lobbies and save workspaces. Each lobby should have been able to own a workspace in which there would include different classes. It could also be possible to import and export java classes to local spaces. These features could have been implemented but as mentioned the workload and time was sadly not incoherent.
            <br><br>What we thought was interesting during the making of our program was really just the progress. We could see our idea come to life! We now have a better understanding for sending packages over a TCP connection, and being able to differ between clientListeners and ServerListeners.
            <br><br>The project is interesting but some functions were too time-consuming to implement. Thus we are satisfied with the result since the most important features are applied and the program works.
            <br><br>Our advice to other students is to aim high to receive the most out of this project. You will see that you will learn much more if you go out of your comfort zone and do something outside the course plan. Our other advice is that do not be afraid to use resources such as the supervisors.
